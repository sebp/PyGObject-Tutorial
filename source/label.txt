Label
=====

Labels are the main method of placing non-editable text in windows, for instance
to place a title next to a :class:`Gtk.Entry` widget. You can specify the text
in the constructor, or later with the :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_text` or
:meth:`Gtk.Label.set_markup` methods.

The width of the label will be adjusted automatically. You can produce
multi-line labels by putting line breaks ("\\n") in the label string.

Labels can be made selectable with :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_selectable`.
Selectable labels allow the user to copy the label contents to the
clipboard. Only labels that contain useful-to-copy information —
such as error messages — should be made selectable.

The label text can be justified using the :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_justify` method.
The widget is also capable of word-wrapping, which can be activated with
:meth:`Gtk.Label.set_line_wrap`.

:class:`Gtk.Label` support some simple formatting, for instance allowing you to
make some text bold, colored, or larger. You can do this by providing a string
to :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_markup`, using the
Pango Markup syntax [#pango]_.
For instance, ``<b>bold text</b> and <s>strikethrough text</s>``.
In addition, :class:`Gtk.Label` supports clickable hyperlinks.
The markup for links is borrowed from HTML, using the a with href and title
attributes. GTK+ renders links similar to the way they appear in web browsers,
with colored, underlined text. The title attribute is displayed as a tooltip
on the link.

.. code-block:: python

    label.set_markup("Go to <a href=\"http://www.gtk.org\" "
                     "title=\"Our website\">GTK+ website</a> for more")

Labels may contain *mnemonics*. Mnemonics are underlined characters in the
label, used for keyboard navigation. Mnemonics are created by providing a
string with an underscore before the mnemonic character, such as "_File",
to the functions :meth:`Gtk.Label.new_with_mnemonic` or
:meth:`Gtk.Label.set_text_with_mnemonic`.
Mnemonics automatically activate any activatable widget the label is inside,
such as a :class:`Gtk.Button`; if the label is not inside the mnemonic's target
widget, you have to tell the label about the target using
:meth:`Gtk.Label.set_mnemonic_widget`.
