Expander
========

Expanders allow to dynamically hide or show information within a window or
dialog. An expander can take a single widget that will be displayed when
expanded.

Expanders remain expanded until clicked again. When the state of an expander
is changed, the "activate" signal is emitted.

An expander can be programmatically expanded or collapsed by passing `True` or
`False` to :meth:`Gtk.Expander.set_expanded`. Note that doing so causes the
"activate" signal to be emitted.

Adding More Widgets
-------------------

More than one widget, such as a Label and Button, can be added by fitting them
within a :Gtk.Box:
