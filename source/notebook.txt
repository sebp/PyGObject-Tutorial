Notebook Containers
===================
The :class:`Gtk.Notebook` widget is a :class:`Gtk.Container` whose children are pages that can be switched between using tab labels along one edge.

There are many configuration options for GtkNotebook. Among other things, you can choose on which edge the tabs appear (see :meth:`Gtk.Notebook.set_tab_pos`), whether, if there are too many tabs to fit the notebook should be made bigger or scrolling arrows added (see :meth:`Gtk.Notebook.set_scrollable`, and whether there will be a popup menu allowing the users to switch pages. (see :meth:`Gtk.Notebook.popup_enable`, :meth:`Gtk.Notebook.popup_disable`)
