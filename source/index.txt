The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial
==========================

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|
:Copyright: GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts

This tutorial gives an introduction to writing GTK+ 3 applications in Python.

Prior to working through this tutorial, it is recommended that you
have a reasonable grasp of the Python programming language.
GUI programming introduces new problems compared to interacting
with the standard output (console / terminal).
It is necessary for you to know how to create and run Python files,
understand basic interpreter errors, and work with strings, integers,
floats and Boolean values.
For the more advanced widgets in this tutorial, good knowledge of
lists and tuples will be needed.

Although this tutorial describes the most important classes and methods within
GTK+ 3, it is not supposed to serve as an API reference. Please refer to the
`GTK+ 3 Reference Manual <http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/>`_ for a
detailed description of the API. Also there's a `Python-specific reference
<http://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/>`_ available.
