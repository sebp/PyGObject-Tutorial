The PyGObject Tutorial
======================

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

This is a tutorial introducing GTK+ 3 and Python.

Prior to working through this tutorial, it is recommended that you
have a reasonable grasp of the Python programming language.
GUI programming introduces new problems compares to interacting
with the standard output (console / terminal).
It is necessary for you to know how to create and run Python files,
understanding basic interpreter errors, work with strings, integers,
floats and Boolean values.
For the more advanced widgets in this tutorial, good knowledge of
lists and tuples will be needed.

Although, this tutorial describes the most important classes and methods within
GTK+ 3, this is not supposed to be an API documentation. Please refer to the
`GTK+ 3 Reference Manual <http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/>`_ for a
detailed description of the API.
