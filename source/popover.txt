Popovers
========

The GtkPopover is a seperate Window used for displaying additional information and are often used as 
a part of button menus and context menus. Their uses are similar to those of dialog windows with the advantage of being less
disruptive and having a connection with the widget the popover is pointing to.
Popovers have are visually connected to a related Widget with a small triangle.


A Popover can be created with :class:`Gtk.Popover`; for opening the Popover use :meth:`Gtk.Widget.show_all`.
