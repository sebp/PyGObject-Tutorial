Popovers
========

The :class:`Gtk.Popover` is a seperate window used for displaying additional
information and are often used as a part of button menus and context menus.
Their uses are similar to those of dialog windows with the advantage of being less
disruptive and having a connection with the widget the popover is pointing to.
Popovers have are visually connected to a related widget with a small triangle.

A Popover can be created with :class:`Gtk.Popover`; for opening the popover use
:meth:`Gtk.Widget.show_all`.
