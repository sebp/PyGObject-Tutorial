Tree and List Widgets
=====================

A :class:`Gtk.TreeView` and its associated widgets are an extremely powerful way
of displaying data. They are used in conjunction with a :class:`Gtk.ListStore`
or :class:`Gtk.TreeStore` and provide a way of displaying and manipulating data
in many ways, including:

    * Automatically updates when data added, removed or edited
    * Drag and drop support
    * Sorting of data
    * Support embedding widgets such as check boxes, progress bars, etc.
    * Reorderable and resizable columns
    * Filtering of data

With the power and flexibility of a :class:`Gtk.TreeView` comes complexity. It
is often difficult for beginner developers to be able to utilize correctly due
to the number of methods which are required.

The Model
---------
Each :class:`Gtk.TreeView` has an associated :class:`Gtk.TreeModel`, which
contains the data displayed by the TreeView. Each :class:`Gtk.TreeModel` can be
used by more than one :class:`Gtk.TreeView`. For instance, this allows the same
underlying data to be displayed and edited in 2 different ways at the same time.
Or the 2 Views might display different columns from the same Model data, in the
same way that 2 SQL queries (or "views") might show different fields from the
same database table.

Although you can theoretically implement your own Model, you will normally use
either the :class:`Gtk.ListStore` or :class:`Gtk.TreeStore` model classes.
:class:`Gtk.ListStore` contains simple rows of data, and each row has no children,
whereas :class:`Gtk.TreeStore` contains rows of data, and each row may have child
rows.

When constructing a model you have to specify the data types for each column the
model holds.

.. code-block:: python

    store = Gtk.ListStore(str, str, float)

This creates a list store with three columns, two string columns, and a float
column.

Adding data to the model is done using :meth:`Gtk.ListStore.append` or
:meth:`Gtk.TreeStore.append`, depending upon which sort of model was created.

.. code-block:: python

    treeiter = store.append(["The Art of Computer Programming",
                             "Donald E. Knuth", 25.46])

Both methods return a :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` instance, which points to the location
of the newly inserted row. You can retrieve a :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` by calling
:meth:`Gtk.TreeModel.get_iter`.

Once, data has been inserted you can retrieve or modify data using the tree iter
and column index.

.. code-block:: python

    print store[treeiter][2] # Prints value of third column
    store[treeiter][2] = 42.15

As with Python's built-in :class:`list` object you can use :func:`len` to get the number
of rows and use slices to retrieve or set values.

.. code-block:: python

    # Print number of rows
    print len(store)
    # Print all but first column
    print store[treeiter][1:]
    # Print last column
    print store[treeiter][-1]
    # Set first two columns
    store[treeiter][:2] = ["Donald Ervin Knuth", 41.99]

Iterating over all rows of a tree model is very simple as well.

.. code-block:: python

    for row in store:
        # Print values of all columns
        print row[:]

Keep in mind, that if you use :class:`Gtk.TreeStore`, the above code will only
iterate over the rows of the top level, but not the children of the nodes.
To iterate over all rows and its children, use the ``print_tree_store`` function.

.. code-block:: python

    def print_tree_store(store):
        rootiter = store.get_iter_first()
        print_rows(store, rootiter, "")

    def print_rows(store, treeiter, indent):
        while treeiter != None:
            print indent + str(store[treeiter][:])
            if store.iter_has_child(treeiter):
                childiter = store.iter_children(treeiter)
                print_rows(store, childiter, indent + "\t")
            treeiter = store.iter_next(treeiter)

Apart from accessing values stored in a :class:`Gtk.TreeModel` with the list-like
method mentioned above, it is also possible to
either use :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` or :class:`Gtk.TreePath` instances. Both reference
a particular row in a tree model.
One can convert a path to an iterator by calling :meth:`Gtk.TreeModel.get_iter`.
As :class:`Gtk.ListStore` contains only one level,
i.e. nodes do not have any child nodes, a path is essentially the index of the row
you want to access.

.. code-block:: python

    # Get path pointing to 6th row in list store
    path = Gtk.TreePath(5)
    treeiter = liststore.get_iter(path)
    # Get value at 2nd column
    value = liststore.get_value(treeiter, 1)

In the case of :class:`Gtk.TreeStore`, a path is a list of indexes or a string.
The string form is a list of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to
the offset at that level. Thus, the path "0" refers to the root node and the
path "2:4" refers to the fifth child of the third node.

.. code-block:: python

    # Get path pointing to 5th child of 3rd row in tree store
    path = Gtk.TreePath([2, 4])
    treeiter = treestore.get_iter(path)
    # Get value at 2nd column
    value = treestore.get_value(treeiter, 1)

Instances of :class:`Gtk.TreePath` can be accessed like lists, i.e.
``len(treepath)`` returns the depth of the item ``treepath`` is pointing to,
and ``treepath[i]`` returns the child's index on the *i*-th level.

TreeModel Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Gtk.TreeModel()

    .. method:: get_iter(path)

        Returns a :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` instance pointing to *path*.

        *path* is expected to be a colon separated list of numbers or a tuple. For
        example, the string "10:4:0" or tuple (10, 4, 0) would create a path of depth
        3 pointing to the 11th child of the root node, the 5th child of that 11th
        child, and the 1st child of that 5th child.

    .. method:: iter_next(treeiter)

        Returns a :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` instance pointing the node following
        *treeiter* at the current level or ``None`` if there is no next iter.

    .. method:: iter_previous(treeiter)

        Returns a :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` instance pointing the node previous to
        *treeiter* at the current level or ``None`` if there is no previous iter.

    .. method:: iter_has_child(treeiter)

        Returns ``True`` if *treeiter* has children, ``False`` otherwise.

    .. method:: iter_children(treeiter)

        Returns a :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` instance pointing to the first child of
        *treeiter* or ``None`` if *treeiter* has no children.

    .. method:: get_iter_first()

        Returns a :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` instance pointing to the first iterator
        in the tree (the one at the path "0") or ``None`` if the tree is empty.

ListStore Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Gtk.ListStore(data_type[, ...])

    Creates a new :class:`Gtk.ListStore` with the specified column data types.
    Each row added to the list store will have an item in each column.

    Supported data types are the standard Python ones and GTK+ types:

    * str, int, float, long, bool, object
    * GObject.GObject

    .. method:: append([row])

    Appends a new row to this list store.

    *row* is a list of values for each column, i.e. ``len(store) == len(row)``.
    If *row* is omitted or ``None``, an empty row will be appended.

    Returns a :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` pointing to the appended row.

TreeStore Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Gtk.TreeStore(data_type[, ...])

    Arguments are the same as for the :class:`Gtk.ListStore` constructor.

    .. method:: append(parent, [row])

    Appends a new row to this tree store. *parent* must be a valid :class:`Gtk.TreeIter`.
    If *parent* is not ``None``, then it will append the new row after the last
    child of *parent*, otherwise it will append a row to the top level.

    *row* is a list of values for each column, i.e. ``len(store) == len(row)``.
    If *row* is omitted or ``None``, an empty row will be appended.

    Returns a :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` pointing to the appended row.

TreePath Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Gtk.TreePath(path)

    Construct a :class:`Gtk.TreePath` pointing to the node specified by *path*.

    If *path* is a string it is expected to be a colon separated list of numbers.
    For example, the string "10:4:0" would create a path of depth 3 pointing to
    the 11th child of the root node, the 5th child of that 11th child, and the
    1st child of that 5th child.

    If *path* is a list or a tuple it is expected to contain the indexes of the nodes.
    Referring to the above mentioned example, the expression ``Gtk.TreePath("10:4:0")``
    is equivalent to ``Gtk.TreePath([10, 4, 3])``.

The View
--------
While there are several different models to choose from, there is only one view
widget to deal with. It works with either the list or the tree store. Setting up
a :class:`Gtk.TreeView` is not a difficult matter. It needs a
:class:`Gtk.TreeModel` to know where to retrieve its data from, either by
passing it to the :class:`Gtk.TreeView` constructor, or by calling
:meth:`Gtk.TreeView.set_model`.

.. code-block:: python

    tree = Gtk.TreeView(store)

Once the :class:`Gtk.TreeView` widget has a model, it will need to know how to
display the model. It does this with columns and cell renderers.

Cell renderers are used to draw the data in the tree model in a way. There are a
number of cell renderers that come with GTK+, for instance
:class:`Gtk.CellRendererText`, :class:`Gtk.CellRendererPixbuf` and
:class:`Gtk.CellRendererToggle`.
In addition, it is relatively easy to write a custom renderer yourself.

A :class:`Gtk.TreeViewColumn` is the object that :class:`Gtk.TreeView` uses to
organize the vertical columns in the tree view. It needs to know the name of the
column to label for the user, what type of cell renderer to use, and which piece
of data to retrieve from the model for a given row.

.. code-block:: python

    renderer = Gtk.CellRendererText()
    column = Gtk.TreeViewColumn("Title", renderer, text=0)
    tree.append_column(column)

To render more than one model column in a view column, you need to create a
:class:`Gtk.TreeViewColumn` instance and use :meth:`Gtk.TreeViewColumn.pack_start`
to add the model columns to it.

.. code-block:: python

    column = Gtk.TreeViewColumn("Title and Author")

    title = Gtk.CellRendererText()
    author = Gtk.CellRendererText()

    column.pack_start(title, True)
    column.pack_start(author, True)

    column.add_attribute(title, "text", 0)
    column.add_attribute(author, "text", 1)

    tree.append_column(column)

TreeView Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Gtk.TreeView([treemodel])

    Creates a new :class:`Gtk.TreeView` widget with the model initialized to
    *treemodel*. *treemodel* must be a class implementing :class:`Gtk.TreeModel`,
    such as :class:`Gtk.ListStore` or :class:`Gtk.TreeStore`. If *treemodel*
    is omitted or ``None``, the model remains unset and you have to call
    :meth:`set_model` later.

    .. method:: set_model(model)

        Sets the model for this tree view. If this tree view already has a model
        set, it will remove it before setting the new model. If *model* is ``None``,
        then it will unset the old model.

    .. method:: get_model()

        Returns the model this tree view is based on. Returns ``None`` if the
        model is unset.

    .. method:: append_column(column)

        Appends *column* to the list of columns.

    .. method:: get_selection()

        Gets the :class:`Gtk.TreeSelection` associated with this tree view.

    .. method:: enable_model_drag_source(start_button_mask, targets, actions)

        Arguments are the same as :meth:`Gtk.Widget.drag_source_set`

    .. method:: enable_model_dest_source(targets, actions)

        Arguments are the same as :meth:`Gtk.Widget.drag_dest_set`

TreeViewColumn Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Gtk.TreeViewColumn(label[, renderer[, **kwargs]])

    Creates a new :class:`Gtk.TreeViewColumn`.

    *renderer* is expected to be a :class:`Gtk.CellRenderer` instance, and
    *kwargs* key-value pairs specifying the default values of *renderer*'s
    properties. This is equivalent to calling :meth:`pack_start` and
    :meth:`add_attribute` for each key-value pair in *kwargs*.

    If *renderer* is omitted, you have to call :meth:`pack_start` or
    :meth:`pack_end` yourself.

    .. method:: add_attribute(renderer, attribute, value)

        Adds an attribute mapping to this column.

        *attribute* is the parameter on *renderer* to be set from the value.
        So for example if column 2 of the model contains strings, you could have
        the "text" attribute of a :class:`Gtk.CellRendererText` get its values
        from column 2.

    .. method:: pack_start(renderer, expand)

        Packs the *renderer* into the beginning of this column. If expand is
        ``False``, then the *renderer* is allocated no more space than it needs.
        Any unused space is divided evenly between cells for which expand is ``True``.

    .. method:: pack_end(renderer, expand)

        Adds the *renderer* to end of this column. If expand is
        ``False``, then the *renderer* is allocated no more space than it needs.
        Any unused space is divided evenly between cells for which expand is ``True``.

    .. method:: set_sort_column_id(sort_column_id)

        Sets the column of the model by which this column (of the view) should be
        sorted. This also makes the columnd header clickable.

    .. method:: get_sort_column_id()

        Gets the column id set by :meth:`Gtk.TreeViewColumn.set_sort_column_id`

    .. method:: set_sort_indicator(setting)

        Sets whether a little arrow is displayed in the column header to in

        *setting* can either be ``True`` (indicator is shown) or ``False``

    .. method:: get_sort_indicator()

        Gets the value set by :meth:`Gtk.TreeViewColumn.set_sort_indicator`

    .. method:: set_sort_order(order)

        Changes the order by which the column is sorted.

        *order* can either be ``Gtk.SortType.ASCENDING`` or ``Gtk.SortType.DESCENDING``.

    .. method:: get_sort_order()

        Gets the sort order set by :meth:`Gtk.TreeViewColumn.set_sort_order`

The Selection
-------------
Most applications will need to not only deal with displaying data, but also
receiving input events from users. To do this, simply get a reference to a
selection object and connect to the "changed" signal.

.. code-block:: python

    select = tree.get_selection()
    select.connect("changed", on_tree_selection_changed)

Then to retrieve data for the row selected:

.. code-block:: python

    def on_tree_selection_changed(selection):
        model, treeiter = selection.get_selected()
        if treeiter != None:
            print "You selected", model[treeiter][0]

You can control what selections are allowed by calling
:meth:`Gtk.TreeSelection.set_mode`.
:meth:`Gtk.TreeSelection.get_selected` does not work if the selection mode is
set to :attr:`Gtk.SelectionMode.MULTIPLE`, use
:meth:`Gtk.TreeSelection.get_selected_rows` instead.


TreeSelection Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Gtk.TreeSelection

    .. method:: set_mode(type)

        Where type is one of

        * :attr:`Gtk.SelectionMode.NONE`: No selection is possible
        * :attr:`Gtk.SelectionMode.SINGLE`: Zero or one element may be selected
        * :attr:`Gtk.SelectionMode.BROWSE`: Exactly one element is selected.
          In some circumstances, such as initially or during a search operation,
          it's possible for no element to be selected. What is really enforced
          is that the user can't deselect a currently selected element except by
          selecting another element.
        * :attr:`Gtk.SelectionMode.MULTIPLE`: Any number of elements may be
          selected. Clicks toggle the state of an item. Any number of elements
          may be selected. The Ctrl key may be used to enlarge the selection,
          and Shift key to select between the focus and the child pointed to.
          Some widgets may also allow Click-drag to select a range of elements.

    .. method:: get_selected()

        Returns a tuple ``(model, treeiter)``, where *model* is the current model
        and *treeiter* a :class:`Gtk.TreeIter` pointing to the currently selected
        row. *treeiter* is ``None`` if no rows are selected.

        This function will not work if the mode of this selection is
        :attr:`Gtk.SelectionMode.MULTIPLE`.

    .. method:: get_selected_rows()

        Returns a list of :class:`Gtk.TreePath` instances of all selected rows.

Sorting
-------
Sorting is an important feature for tree views and is supported by the standard tree models (:class:`Gtk.TreeStore` and :class:`Gtk.ListStore`), which implement the :class:`Gtk.TreeSortable` interface.

Sorting by clicking on columns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A column of a :class:`Gtk.TreeView` can easily made sortable with a call to :meth:`Gtk.TreeViewColumn.set_sort_column_id`.
Afterwards the column can be sorted by clicking on its header.

First we need a simple :class:`Gtk.TreeView` and a :class:`Gtk.ListStore` as a model.

.. code-block:: python

    model = Gtk.ListStore(str)
    model.append(["Benjamin"])
    model.append(["Charles"])
    model.append(["alfred"])
    model.append(["Alfred"])
    model.append(["David"])
    model.append(["charles"])
    model.append(["david"])
    model.append(["benjamin"])

    treeView = Gtk.TreeView(model)

    cellRenderer = Gtk.CellRendererText()
    column = Gtk.TreeViewColumn("Title", renderer, text=0)

The next step is to enable sorting. Note that the *column_id* (``0`` in the example) refers to the column of the model and **not** to the TreeView's column.

.. code-block:: python

    column.set_sort_column_id(0)

Setting a custom sort function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is also possible to set a custom comparison function in order to change the sorting behaviour.
As an example we will create a comparison function that sorts case-sensitive.
In the example above the sorted list looked like::

    alfred
    Alfred
    benjamin
    Benjamin
    charles
    Charles
    david
    David

The case-sensitive sorted list will look like::

    Alfred
    Benjamin
    Charles
    David
    alfred
    benjamin
    charles
    david

First of all a comparison function is needed.
This function gets two rows and has to return a negative integer if the first one should come before the second one, zero if they are equal and a positive integer if the second one should come before the second one.

.. code-block:: python

    def compare(model, row1, row2, user_data):
        sort_column, _ = model.get_sort_column_id()
        value1 = model.get_value(row1, sort_column)
        value2 = model.get_value(row2, sort_column)
        if value1 < value2:
            return -1
        elif value1 == value2:
            return 0
        else:
            return 1

Then the sort function has to be set by :meth:`Gtk.TreeSortable.set_sort_func`.

.. code-block:: python

    model.set_sort_func(0, compare, None)

TreeSortable objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Gtk.TreeSortable()

    .. method:: set_sort_column_id(sort_column_id, order)

        Sets the current sort column to *sort_column_id*.

        *order* can either be ``Gtk.SortType.ASCENDING`` or ``Gtk.SortType.DESCENDING``.

    .. method:: get_sort_column_id()

        Returns a tuple consisting of the current sort column and order.

    .. method:: set_sort_func(sort_column_id, sort_func, user_data)

        Sets the comparison function used when sorting by the colum *sort_column_id*.

        *user_data* gets passed to *sort_func*.

        *sort_func* is a function with the signature ``sort_func(model, iter1, iter2, user_data)``
        and should return a negative integer if *iter1* sorts before *iter2*,
        zero if they are equal and a positive integer if *iter2* sorts before *iter1*.

    .. method:: set_default_sort_func(sort_func, user_data)

        See :meth:`Gtk.TreeSortable.set_sort_func`. This sets the comparison
        function that is used when sorting by the default sort column
