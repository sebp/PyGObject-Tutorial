msgid "The :class:`Gtk.ProgressBar` is typically used to display the progress of a long running operation. It provides a visual clue that processing is underway. The :class:`Gtk.ProgressBar` can be used in two different modes: *percentage mode* and *activity mode*."

#: ../../source/progressbar.txt:9
msgid "When an application can determine how much work needs to take place (e.g. read a fixed number of bytes from a file) and can monitor its progress, it can use the :class:`Gtk.ProgressBar` in *percentage mode* and the user sees a growing bar indicating the percentage of the work that has been completed. In this mode, the application is required to call :meth:`Gtk.ProgressBar.set_fraction` periodically to update the progress bar, passing a float between 0 and 1 to provide the new percentage value."

#: ../../source/progressbar.txt:17
msgid "When an application has no accurate way of knowing the amount of work to do, it can use *activity mode*, which shows activity by a block moving back and forth within the progress area. In this mode, the application is required to call :meth:`Gtk.ProgressBar.pulse` periodically to update the progress bar. You can also choose the step size, with the :meth:`Gtk.ProgressBar.set_pulse_step` method."

#: ../../source/progressbar.txt:24
msgid "By default, :class:`Gtk.ProgressBar` is horizontal and left-to-right, but you can change it to a vertical progress bar by using the :meth:`Gtk.ProgressBar.set_orientation` method. Changing the direction the progress bar grows can be done using :meth:`Gtk.ProgressBar.set_inverted`. :class:`Gtk.ProgressBar` can also contain text which can be set by calling :meth:`Gtk.ProgressBar.set_text` and :meth:`Gtk.ProgressBar.set_show_text`."
