msgid "The :class:`Gtk.Builder` class offers you the opportunity to design user interfaces without writing a single line of code. This is possible through describing the interface by a XML file and then loading the XML description at runtime and create the objects automatically, which the Builder class does for you. For the purpose of not needing to write the XML manually the `Glade <https://glade.gnome.org/>`_ application lets you create the user interface in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) manner"

msgid "First of all you have to download and install Glade. There are `several tutorials <https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Glade/Tutorials>`_ about Glade, so this is not explained here in detail. Let's start by creating a window with a button in it and saving it to a file named *example.glade*. The resulting XML file should look like this."

#: ../../source/builder.txt:42
msgid "To load this file in Python we need a :class:`Gtk.Builder` object."

msgid "These two methods exist also for loading from a string rather than a file. Their corresponding names are :meth:`Gtk.Builder.add_from_string` and :meth:`Gtk.Builder.add_objects_from_string` and they simply take a XML string instead of a file name."

#: ../../source/builder.txt:83
msgid "Glade also makes it possible to define signals which you can connect to handlers in your code without extracting every object from the builder and connecting to the signals manually. The first thing to do is to declare the signal names in Glade. For this example we will act when the window should be closed and when the button was pressed, so we give the name \"onDeleteWindow\" to the \"delete-event\" signal of the window and \"onButtonPressed\" to the \"pressed\" signal of the button. Now the XML file should look like this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/builder.txt:91
msgid "Now we have to define the handler functions in our code. The *onDeleteWindow* should simply result in a call to :meth:`Gtk.main_quit`. When the button is pressed we would like to print the string \"Hello World!\", so we define the handler as follows"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/builder.txt:100
msgid "Next, we have to connect the signals and the handler functions. The easiest way to do this is to define a *dict* with a mapping from the names to the handlers and then pass it to the :meth:`Gtk.Builder.connect_signals` method."
