msgid "Similarly to :class:`Gtk.TreeView`, :class:`Gtk.IconView` uses a :class:`Gtk.ListStore` for its model. Instead of using :ref:`cell renderers <cellrenderers>`, :class:`Gtk.IconView` requires that one of the columns in its :class:`Gtk.ListStore` contains :class:`GdkPixbuf.Pixbuf` objects."

#: ../../source/iconview.txt:7
msgid ":class:`Gtk.IconView` supports numerous selection modes to allow for either selecting multiple icons at a time, restricting selections to just one item or disallowing selecting items completely. To specify a selection mode, the :meth:`Gtk.IconView.set_selection_mode` method is used with one of the :class:`Gtk.SelectionMode` selection modes."
