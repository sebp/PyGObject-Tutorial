msgid "The first step before we start with actual coding consists of setting up `PyGObject`_ and its dependencies. PyGObject is a Python module that enables developers to access GObject-based libraries such as GTK+ within Python. It exclusively supports GTK+ version 3 or later. If you want to use GTK+ 2 in your application, use `PyGTK`_, instead."
