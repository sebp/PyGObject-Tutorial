msgid "Versions of PyGObject < 3.0.3 contain a bug which does not allow drag and drop to function correctly. Therefore a version of PyGObject >= 3.0.3 is required for the following examples to work."

#: ../../source/drag_and_drop.txt:8
msgid "Setting up drag and drop between widgets consists of selecting a drag source (the widget which the user starts the drag from) with the :meth:`Gtk.Widget.drag_source_set` method, selecting a drag destination (the widget which the user drops onto) with the :meth:`Gtk.Widget.drag_dest_set` method and then handling the relevant signals on both widgets."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/drag_and_drop.txt:14
msgid "Instead of using :meth:`Gtk.Widget.drag_source_set` and :meth:`Gtk.Widget.drag_dest_set` some specialised widgets require the use of specific functions (such as :class:`Gtk.TreeView` and :class:`Gtk.IconView`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/drag_and_drop.txt:18
msgid "A basic drag and drop only requires the source to connect to the \"drag-data-get\" signal and the destination to connect to the \"drag-data-received\" signal. More complex things such as specific drop areas and custom drag icons will require you to connect to :ref:`additional signals <drag-signals>` and interact with the :class:`Gdk.DragContext` object it supplies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/drag_and_drop.txt:24
msgid "In order to transfer data between the source and destination, you must interact with the :class:`Gtk.SelectionData` variable supplied in the :ref:`\"drag-data-get\" <drag-signals>` and :ref:`\"drag-data-received\" <drag-signals>` signals using the :class:`Gtk.SelectionData` get and set methods."

msgid "To allow the drag source and destination to know what data they are receiving and sending, a common list of :class:`Gtk.TargetEntry's <Gtk.TargetEntry>` are required. A :class:`Gtk.TargetEntry` describes a piece of data that will be sent by the drag source and received by the drag destination."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/drag_and_drop.txt:36
msgid "There are two ways of adding :class:`Gtk.TargetEntry's <Gtk.TargetEntry>` to a source and destination. If the drag and drop is simple and each target entry is of a different type, you can use the group of methods :meth:`mentioned here <Gtk.Widget.drag_source_add_text_targets>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/drag_and_drop.txt:41
msgid "If you require more than one type of data or wish to do more complex things with the data, you will need to create the :class:`Gtk.TargetEntry's <Gtk.TargetEntry>` using the :meth:`Gtk.TargetEntry.new` method."
