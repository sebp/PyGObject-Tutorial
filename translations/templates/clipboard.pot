msgid ":class:`Gtk.Clipboard` provides a storage area for a variety of data, including text and images. Using a clipboard allows this data to be shared between applications through actions such as copying, cutting, and pasting. These actions are usually done in three ways: using keyboard shortcuts, using a :class:`Gtk.MenuItem`, and connecting the functions to :class:`Gtk.Button` widgets."
