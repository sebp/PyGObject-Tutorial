msgid "Prior to working through this tutorial, it is recommended that you have a reasonable grasp of the Python programming language. GUI programming introduces new problems compared to interacting with the standard output (console / terminal). It is necessary for you to know how to create and run Python files, understand basic interpreter errors, and work with strings, integers, floats and Boolean values. For the more advanced widgets in this tutorial, good knowledge of lists and tuples will be needed."

Please refer to the `GTK+ 3 Reference Manual <https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/>`_ for a detailed description of the API. Also there's a `Python-specific reference <https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/>`_ available."
