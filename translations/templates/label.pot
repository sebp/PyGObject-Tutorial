msgid "Labels are the main method of placing non-editable text in windows, for instance to place a title next to a :class:`Gtk.Entry` widget. You can specify the text in the constructor, or later with the :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_text` or :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_markup` methods."

msgid "Labels can be made selectable with :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_selectable`. Selectable labels allow the user to copy the label contents to the clipboard. Only labels that contain useful-to-copy information — such as error messages — should be made selectable."

msgid "The label text can be justified using the :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_justify` method. The widget is also capable of word-wrapping, which can be activated with :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_line_wrap`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.txt:21
msgid ":class:`Gtk.Label` support some simple formatting, for instance allowing you to make some text bold, colored, or larger. You can do this by providing a string to :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_markup`, using the Pango Markup syntax [#pango]_. For instance, ``<b>bold text</b> and <s>strikethrough text</s>``. In addition, :class:`Gtk.Label` supports clickable hyperlinks. The markup for links is borrowed from HTML, using the a with href and title attributes. GTK+ renders links similar to the way they appear in web browsers, with colored, underlined text. The title attribute is displayed as a tooltip on the link."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/label.txt:37
msgid "Labels may contain *mnemonics*. Mnemonics are underlined characters in the label, used for keyboard navigation. Mnemonics are created by providing a string with an underscore before the mnemonic character, such as \"_File\", to the functions :meth:`Gtk.Label.new_with_mnemonic` or :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_text_with_mnemonic`. Mnemonics automatically activate any activatable widget the label is inside, such as a :class:`Gtk.Button`; if the label is not inside the mnemonic's target widget, you have to tell the label about the target using :meth:`Gtk.Label.set_mnemonic_widget`."
