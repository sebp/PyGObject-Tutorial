msgid "While many GUI toolkits require you to precisely place widgets in a window, using absolute positioning, GTK+ uses a different approach. Rather than specifying the position and size of each widget in the window, you can arrange your widgets in rows, columns, and/or tables. The size of your window can be determined automatically, based on the sizes of the widgets it contains. And the sizes of the widgets are, in turn, determined by the amount of text they contain, or the minimum and maximum sizes that you specify, and/or how you have requested that the available space should be shared between sets of widgets. You can perfect your layout by specifying padding distance and centering values for each of your widgets. GTK+ then uses all this information to resize and reposition everything sensibly and smoothly when the user manipulates the window."

#: ../../source/layout.txt:19
msgid "GTK+ arranges widgets hierarchically, using *containers*. They are invisible to the end user and are inserted into a window, or placed within each other to layout components. There are two flavours of containers: single-child containers, which are all descendants of :class:`Gtk.Bin`, and multiple-child containers, which are descendants of :class:`Gtk.Container`. The most commonly used are vertical or horizontal boxes (:class:`Gtk.Box`) and grids (:class:`Gtk.Grid`)."

#: ../../source/layout.txt:31
msgid "Boxes are invisible containers into which we can pack our widgets. When packing widgets into a horizontal box, the objects are inserted horizontally from left to right or right to left depending on whether :meth:`Gtk.Box.pack_start` or :meth:`Gtk.Box.pack_end` is used. In a vertical box, widgets are packed from top to bottom or vice versa. You may use any combination of boxes inside or beside other boxes to create the desired effect."

msgid ":class:`Gtk.Grid` is a container which arranges its child widgets in rows and columns, but you do not need to specify the dimensions in the constructor. Children are added using :meth:`Gtk.Grid.attach`. They can span multiple rows or columns. The :meth:`Gtk.Grid.attach` method takes five parameters:"

msgid "Using :class:`Gtk.ListBox` is often an alternative to :class:`Gtk.TreeView`, especially when the list content has a more complicated layout than what is allowed by a :class:`Gtk.CellRenderer`, or when the content is interactive (i.e. has a button in it)."
