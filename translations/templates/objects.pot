A :class:`Gtk.Widget` is an inherited class of a :class:`GObject.GObject`. It may be interesting to make an inherited class to create a new widget, like a settings dialog."

msgid "Each signal is registered in the type system together with the type on which it can be emitted: users of the type are said to connect to the signal on a given type instance when they register a function to be invoked upon the signal emission. Users can also emit the signal by themselves or stop the emission of the signal from within one of the functions connected to the signal."
