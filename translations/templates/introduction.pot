msgid "To start with our tutorial we create the simplest program possible. This program will create an empty 200 x 200 pixel window."

msgid "In the beginning, we have to import the Gtk module to be able to access GTK+'s classes and functions. Since a user's system can have multiple versions of GTK+ installed at the same, we want to make sure that when we import Gtk that it refers to GTK+ 3 and not any other version of the library, which is the purpose of the statement ``gi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0')``."

msgid "Followed by connecting to the window's delete event to ensure that the application is terminated if we click on the *x* to close the window."

#: ../../source/introduction.txt:66
msgid "This example differs from the simple example as we sub-class :class:`Gtk.Window` to define our own :class:`MyWindow` class."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/introduction.txt:72
msgid "In the class's constructor we have to call the constructor of the super class. In addition, we tell it to set the value of the property `title` to `Hello World`."

msgid "The next three lines are used to create a button widget, connect to its `clicked` signal and add it as child to the top-level window."

#: ../../source/introduction.txt:84
msgid "Accordingly, the method :meth:`on_button_clicked` will be called if you click on the button."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/introduction.txt:89
msgid "The last block, outside of the class, is very similar to the simple example above, but instead of creating an instance of the generic :class:`Gtk.Window` class, we create an instance of :class:`MyWindow`."
