msgid "Conceptionally, a string is a list of characters such as 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'É'. **Characters** are abstract representations and their meaning depends on the language and context they are used in. The Unicode standard describes how characters are represented by **code points**. For example the characters above are represented with the code points U+0041, U+0042, U+0043, and U+00C9, respectively. Basically, code points are numbers in the range from 0 to 0x10FFFF."

One of the most commonly used encodings that addresses this problem is UTF-8 (it can handle any Unicode code point). UTF stands for \"Unicode Transformation Format\", and the '8' means that 8-bit numbers are used in the encoding."

Instances of the latter are used to express Unicode strings, whereas instances of the :class:`str` type are byte representations (the encoded string). Under the hood, Python represents Unicode strings as either 16- or 32-bit integers, depending on how the Python interpreter was compiled. Unicode strings can be converted to 8-bit strings with :meth:`unicode.encode`::"
